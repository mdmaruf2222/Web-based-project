Student Performance Prediction System | Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas
Developed a machine learning model to predict student average scores based on academic and demographic data. The project includes:

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables

Feature engineering: Calculated average score from math, reading, and writing scores

Exploratory Data Analysis: Correlation heatmaps to identify important factors

Modeling: Trained Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models

Evaluation: Compared models using R² score and RMSE metrics

Insights: Identified key features affecting student performance using feature importance analysis
